# AWS Compute
AWS Compute is a suite of cloud-based services offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that provides scalable and flexible computing resources. 
AWS Compute includes a range of services that allow businesses to run applications and services on the cloud, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), 
AWS Lambda, AWS Batch, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

Amazon EC2 is a highly scalable virtual machine that allows businesses to run a wide range of applications on the cloud. 
EC2 instances can be easily configured to meet specific compute, memory, and storage requirements, and can be quickly scaled up or down as needed.

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows businesses to run code without provisioning or managing servers. 
With Lambda, businesses can simply upload their code, and AWS takes care of the rest, automatically scaling and managing the infrastructure as needed.

AWS Batch is a service that allows businesses to run batch computing workloads on the cloud. 
Batch allows businesses to easily schedule and manage batch computing jobs, and provides automatic scaling to ensure that jobs are completed quickly and efficiently.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a service that allows businesses to quickly and easily deploy and manage web applications on the cloud. 
Elastic Beanstalk handles the underlying infrastructure, such as scaling and load balancing, allowing businesses to focus on developing their applications.

AWS Compute also includes a range of other services, such as Amazon Lightsail, AWS Fargate, and AWS Outposts, among others. 
These services provide businesses with even more options for running their applications on the cloud, 
and allow them to choose the service that best fits their specific needs.
