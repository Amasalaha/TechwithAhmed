# AWS Compute
AWS Compute is a suite of cloud-based services offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that provides scalable and flexible computing resources. 
AWS Compute includes a range of services that allow businesses to run applications and services on the cloud, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), 
AWS Lambda, AWS Batch, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

Amazon EC2 is a highly scalable virtual machine that allows businesses to run a wide range of applications on the cloud. 
EC2 instances can be easily configured to meet specific compute, memory, and storage requirements, and can be quickly scaled up or down as needed.

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows businesses to run code without provisioning or managing servers. 
With Lambda, businesses can simply upload their code, and AWS takes care of the rest, automatically scaling and managing the infrastructure as needed.

AWS Batch is a service that allows businesses to run batch computing workloads on the cloud. 
Batch allows businesses to easily schedule and manage batch computing jobs, and provides automatic scaling to ensure that jobs are completed quickly and efficiently.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a service that allows businesses to quickly and easily deploy and manage web applications on the cloud. 
Elastic Beanstalk handles the underlying infrastructure, such as scaling and load balancing, allowing businesses to focus on developing their applications.

AWS Compute also includes a range of other services, such as Amazon Lightsail, AWS Fargate, and AWS Outposts, among others. 
These services provide businesses with even more options for running their applications on the cloud, 
and allow them to choose the service that best fits their specific needs.

AWS Compute offers businesses a flexible and scalable infrastructure for running their applications and services on the cloud. With its range of services, 
businesses can choose the service that best fits their specific requirements, and can easily scale up or down as needed to meet changing demands.
AWS Compute is an essential part of the AWS cloud platform and has helped many businesses to modernize their IT infrastructure and gain a competitive advantage in today's digital economy

# Interacting on AWS
Interacting with AWS is a fundamental skill for anyone working with cloud-based systems. AWS provides a range of tools and interfaces that allow users to interact with the platform, including the AWS Management Console, command-line interface (CLI), and software development kits (SDKs) for a range of programming languages.

The AWS Management Console is a web-based interface that allows users to manage and monitor their AWS resources. The console provides a user-friendly interface for tasks such as launching EC2 instances, creating S3 buckets, and configuring security groups.

The AWS CLI is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with AWS using command-line commands. The CLI provides a more powerful and efficient way to interact with AWS resources, and is often used by developers and system administrators who need to automate tasks or work with large numbers of resources.

AWS SDKs are available for a range of programming languages, including Java, Python, Ruby, and .NET. SDKs provide a set of APIs that allow developers to interact with AWS resources programmatically, and can be used to build applications that run on the AWS platform.

In addition to these tools, AWS also provides a range of APIs and services that allow developers to build custom interfaces and integrations with other systems. For example, the AWS API Gateway can be used to create custom APIs that allow applications to interact with AWS services, and the AWS Lambda function can be used to execute code in response to events and triggers.

Overall, interacting with AWS requires a solid understanding of the AWS platform and its various services, as well as the tools and interfaces that are available to interact with it. By mastering these skills, developers and system administrators can effectively manage and monitor their AWS resources and build powerful and scalable cloud-based applications.

# Security And AWS Shared Responsibility Method
- The AWS shared responsibility model is a security model that defines the responsibilities of both AWS and its customers for the security of the cloud. AWS is responsible for the security of the cloud, while customers are responsible for the security of their data and applications in the cloud. This model ensures a secure and reliable cloud environment for all users

- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a powerful tool for managing security in AWS. IAM allows users to create and manage users and groups, set permissions for resources, and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security. By using IAM, users can ensure that their AWS resources are secure and accessible only to authorized users.
